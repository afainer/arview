#+TITLE: arview.el --- extract and view archives in temporary directories

* Commentary
  Arview extracts an archive file in a temporary directory and opens a
  dired buffer for the directory.  Each archive has a unique temporary
  directory:
  
  : `temporary-file-directory'/arview-<archive-filename>.<random-string>
  
  Arview deletes the directory of the extracted archive when its dired
  buffer is killed.
  
  For remote archives arview copies them to
  =temporary-file-directory=.  When the dired buffer of the copied
  archive is killed and deleted its directory, the archive is deleted
  too.
  
  Arview is useful when archives have big directory trees and it is
  inconvenient to view their content with =archive-mode=.  Or if you
  want to use external programs on archived files, or copy them to
  some other place, or do some sophisticated processing.
  
  Use the command ~arview~ which asks for an archive file name.  In
  ~dired-mode~ use ~arview-dired~ (bound to C-return by default).
  When the commands called with one prefix argument, arview prompts
  you for another temporary directory instead of the default one.
  With two prefix arguments you can also specify additional arguments
  for the archive program.
  
  To use arview, make sure that this file is in load-path and insert
  in your .emacs:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'arview)
  #+END_SRC
